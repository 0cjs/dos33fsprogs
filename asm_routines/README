some common assembly language routines for Apple II

for a while I was using this as a shared core of common code

however it broke things when I'd improve the code and other locations
sharing the code would depend on the old behavior.

now I usually have copies of the code in each project, which of course
can get out of date, but don't run the risk of causing breakage
