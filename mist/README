MIST -- a reimplementation of MYST from scratch for Apple II computers



Compiling:
	This is a bit tricky
	First you'll need to install the cc65 package
		https://github.com/cc65/cc65
	You'll need to install lzsa
		https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa
	You might need to install lz4-dev for some of the helper
		utils to compile

	Then run "make" and hope for the best
