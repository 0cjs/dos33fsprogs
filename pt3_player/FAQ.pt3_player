PT3_Player Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Will this play on any Apple II?

A. Yes, though you need a Mockingboard in Slot 4 to hear the music.

	You probably need 48k of RAM too.


Q: Can you fit more than 18 songs on the disk?

A: Yes, it depends on how complex the PT3 files are.
   Also, PT3 files compress nicely and I could fit even more if I LZ4
	compressed them, it's just that would make it harder for other
	people to use the player.

	Yes, I could write code that automatically decode in LZ4 encoded,
	but that gets tricky for various reasons, and you also need
	some RAM to decode the image into.
