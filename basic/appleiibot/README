This is where I develop the various things I send to the twitter
AppleIIbot.

For more info see here:
	http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/appleiibot/

For the sources to the assembly language demos:
	flame is in ../fire
	autumn/seasons is in ../seasons
	the double-hires demos are in ../dhgr

tools:
	./convert_qkumba will take a 128 byte or smaller binary
		designed to run at $300 and create a basic loader for it

	../asoft_basic-utils/tokenize_asoft will tokenize your basic program

	../hgr-utils/shape_table lets you edit shape tables as a text file


See: README.PACKER for how the packers work
