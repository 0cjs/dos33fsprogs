BEHAVIOR DIFFERENCES:
=====================

+ General differences
	* physicist behavior:
		- should be separate sprites for left/right
		  (not one flipped sprite)
		- actual game has much more variety of movement positions
		- if have gun, should be visible when running.  Hard to do
		  this in a way that looks right

	* alien guard behavior:
		- will punch you if you get too close
		- l4, if you draw gun (but not fire) guard won't shoot you,
		  but instead will yell at you a bit

	* gun behavior:
		- doors/walls should explode outward away from blast
		  *unless* there is another door/wall behind it
		- laser should show sparks when hits shields/walls
		- shield cannot be placed if room/floor wrong
		- shield collapse animation if blown up with blast

	* door behavior:
		- blasted doors, the remains appear partly in front


+ Level/Checkpoint 1

	* underwater:
		- underwater in game there is a subtle water-motion effect
		- bubble motion is fancier in real thing

	* by the pool:
		- get out of water, you face forward unless key pressed
		  (we don't have a forward sprite as it looks weird)
		- arrival, the beast movement seems to depend on your xpos?
		- small things like birds flying are not implemented

	* caverns:
		- beast on hill and 2nd screen -- complex, only appears if
		  you happen to leave same time beast does?  then movement
		  depends on xposition?
		- sometimes falling rocks can follow you to next screen

	* rope:
		- earthquake should happen while on rope

	* beast:
		- beast can/should trip and fall if it gets close in the pool
			room while running?




+ Level/Checkpoint 2

	* cage room:
		- in game, after some time the guard calms down

	* jail:
		- in actual game, foreground animations can continue
		  to next screen?
		- flashes on wall from gunfire in neighboring room

	* level end:
		- you should fall/scroll halfway down the shaft, then roll
		  a bit before falling into L3

	* Elevator:
		- should be able to change elevator direction mid-floor
		- Elevator should shoot sparks every 20 frames or so

	* View:
		- does music play when looking at city?
		  Not original Amiga version

+ Level/Checkpoint #3:
	* Actual game shakes the camera when you hit the ground after falling

+ Level/Checkpoint #4:
	* Implement guard (shooting, taunting)


KNOWN BUGS:
===========

+ ootw: pool monster grabs you a edge of pool (glitch)
+ intro: there's still a bit of a pause when the elevator door finishes opening
+ running: Missing one running frame (?)


FUTURE WORK:
============
* sprites_to_draw:
  + physicist run+jumping
  + physicist swimming
  + beast tripping
  + alien running
  + friend walking
  + friend running

* L1 pool
  + adjust tentacle to not go off edge of screen
  + adjust x position of tentacle grab

Level/Checkpoint #5:
 + Allow falling into first pit
