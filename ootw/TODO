BEHAVIOR DIFFERENCES:
+ L1
	- underwater there is a water-motion effect
	- bubble motion is fancier in real thing
	- get out of water, you face forward unless key pressed
	  (we don't have a forward sprite as it looks weird)
	- arrival, the beast movement seems to depend on your xpos?
	- small things like birds flying are not implemented
	- beast on hill and 2nd screen -- complex, only appears if
	  you happen to leave same time beast does?  then movement
	  depends on xposition?
        - earthquake can happen while on rope?
	- sometimes falling rocks can follow you to next screen

+ L2
	- gun movement: gun is held by head when running
	- separate left facing vs right facing sprites
