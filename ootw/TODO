BEHAVIOR DIFFERENCES:

alien guard behavior:
	+ will punch you if you get too close
	+ l4, if you draw gun (but not fire) guard won't shoot you,
	  but instead will yell at you a bit

gun behavior:
	+ doors/walls should explode outward away from blast
	  *unless* there is another door/wall behind it
	+ laser should show sparks when hits shields/walls
	+ shield cannot be placed if room/floor wrong
	+ shield collapse animation if blown up with blast

+ L1
	- underwater there is a water-motion effect
	- bubble motion is fancier in real thing
	- get out of water, you face forward unless key pressed
	  (we don't have a forward sprite as it looks weird)
	- arrival, the beast movement seems to depend on your xpos?
	- small things like birds flying are not implemented
	- beast on hill and 2nd screen -- complex, only appears if
	  you happen to leave same time beast does?  then movement
	  depends on xposition?
        - earthquake can happen while on rope?
	- sometimes falling rocks can follow you to next screen

+ L2
	- gun movement: gun is held by head when running
	- separate left facing vs right facing sprites
