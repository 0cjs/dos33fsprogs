and thought the lo-res pallette might be just barely enough to do

Of course you could just play on your IIgs, but what's the fun in that.




Up to tunnel1, using RLE:
	35875	INTRO

		using LZ4:





Memory map:
	00	zero page
	01	stack
	02	????
	03	dos33 nibble table
	04-07	GR page0
	08-0b	GR page1
	0c-0f	offscreen data  ($c00 = disk load buffer)
	10-13	offscreen data2
	14-16	loader
	17-bf	program/data (42.25k)
	c0-cf	I/O
	d0-ff	ROM


Memory squeeze!

	10,748 over	all graphics in
	10,734 over	remove extraneous blank bg image
	 8,658 over	re-arrange memory map, 42k avail now
	 8,562 over	move gr_make_quake out of common code
	 8,374 over	remove extraneous code (mostly put_sprite_flipped)
	 5,469 over     allow changing bg on fly in sequence
	 4,122 over	modify cyan frames to be on fly
	 2,749 over	do same for zappo routines
	 2,493 over	squish disk loader vars to page 3
	 2,165 over	horrible hack to auto-go to next image in sequence
	 2,114 over	move bg loading into seq
	 2,053 over	make elevator indicator a loop
	 1,347 over	use LZ4 instead of RLE

Let's take a 10k region of memory = $3000
	$C000 - $4000 = starting at $8000
