Q. Are you implementing the game just like the original?

A. No, this is just a quick hack using all sprites.
   I'm not doing something amazing like writing a 6502 optimized
   vector drawing library.



Q.  How are you making the graphics?

A.  Using the orignal for reference (currently a Windows/EGA version
    for some reason?)  Size down to 80x40.  Manually map colors to
    Apple II Lo-res pallette.  Then manually adjust to 40x40.
    Finally fine tune in a bit while using original for reference.
