Q. Are you implementing the game just like the original (i.e. vector
	drawing)?

A. No, this is just a quick hack using all sprites.
   I'm not doing something amazing like writing a 6502 optimized
   vector drawing library.



Q.  How are you making the graphics?

A.  Using the original for reference (currently a Windows/EGA version
    for some reason?)  Size down to 80x40.  Manually map colors to
    Apple II Lo-res palette.  Then manually adjust to 40x40.
    Finally fine tune in a bit while using original for reference.


Q.  Why lores graphics?  It's so *horribly* blocky.

A.  Yes, but I like it anyway.  So many colors!
	I spent a lot of time as an ANSI artist so I am used to blocky
	16-color graphics, and to be honest with you my art skills sort
	of peak at that resolution.

	Also Apple II graphics programming is painful and LORES is the
	easiest of them all.

	Partly nostalgia too, but my family only had a monochrome monitor
	so I never got to experience full-color lores back in the day.
	Unfortunately this game doesn't really play well in monochrome.



Q.  Are you going to make a version using Hi-res or Double Hi-res graphics?

A.  No, there's an official version for the Apple IIgs if you want something
	like that.  Apple II hires graphics with sprites are a huge pain
	to program, would probably be slower, and would take up a lot more
	RAM.


Q.  How about double-lores graphics (80x48)?  It would give you almost
	square pixels?

A.  While not as bad as Hires, double-lores is also a pain.  It only
	works on the IIe with 128k or newer.  Also you now have to copy
	things to aux memory, and your sprites have to worry about the
	colors being shifted (I think) on the AUX page.  It will take
	twice the ram and probably run 1/2 the speed.

	Also the current code uses page-flipping to avoid flicker/tearing,
	but doing page-flipping in double-lores is really tricky.


Q.  Why are you targeting such an old machine, an original Apple II or II+?

A.  Well, I own one.  Also there's something about programming on a machine
	from 1977, whose graphics hardware is a glorified shift register,
	and is implemented entirely out of 7400 series logic and 555 timers.
