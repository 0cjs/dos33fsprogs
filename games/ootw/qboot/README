Originally the way things worked:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Regular DOS33 filesystem
+ Title BLOADed by HELLO to $D00, was big enough that
	qkumba's code ended up at $1400-$1700
+ Various levels loaded at $1700
+ We never return to title, so have to reboot at end

Qboot method
~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ qboot_sector, 1 sector loads at $800
+ Loads second stage (two sectors of disk routines) to
	$1400/$1500
+ Loads QLOAD (main disk routine) and TITLE to $1600
+	disk routines fit in $1600/$1700
+ All programs load at $1800
