KSP 1.3.7 for Apple II.

This is a "port" of the awesome Kerbal Space Program to the Apple II.
Just for fun, I am in no way affiliated with Squad.

The game is written entirely in Applesoft BASIC.

Directions:
	The key bindings are similar to KSP.

	A,D   - STEER SHIP LEFT/RIGHT
	Z     - START ENGINES
	X     - CUT ENGINES
	SPACE - LAUNCH,STAGE
	M     - SWITCH TO/FROM ORBITAL VIEW
	<,>   - FAST FORWARD
	Q     - QUIT


Hardware required:
	Apple II and probably 64k of RAM

Thanks to:
+ Steve Wozniak for an awesome machine
+ Lyle Brennen and all my other physics teachers
+ My ever patient wife
+ kdenlive (although it crashes a lot)
+ linapple2 which works nicely
+ vokoscreen which I used to grab the screen grabs

No thanks to:
+ The Linux audio sound ALSA/pulseaudio people
  Seriously, I couldn't record decent audio from a microphone.
  I eventually had to give up and redub it with sound I recorded on a Mac
  (the same hardware even, I had to boot it out of Linux and back to OSX)


APPLE II FOREVER!
