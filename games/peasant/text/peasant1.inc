; + look
.byte "There's a really generic well here. Oh, and apparently it's autumn on this screen.",0

; + look well
.byte "Pretty average. You're not a big well person. You're more into bridges. It does have a cute little bucket though. Your dad liked buckets. Oh, and there's a metal crank too. Meemaw loved cranks.",0

; + turn crank (before pebbles, close)
.byte "It won't budge. Maybe if there was something heavy in that bucket...",0

.byte "You grab up the scary moster maskus. Man, this thing could scare a horse!",0

; + turn crank (after mask, far away)

.byte "Down she goes! You could do this all day!",0

; + turn crank (after mask, close, second time)

; + turn crank (baby)
.byte "You haul the bucket back up. Lucky for you, the baby is still in it and appears to be unscathed. As a bonus, it looks like he found a Meatball sub down there. Score! You take the sub.",0
