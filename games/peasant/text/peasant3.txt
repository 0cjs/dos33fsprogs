# Jhonka cave
##############

# + Type any command other than "yes" or "no" after the Jhonka asks if you stole the riches
Just answer him, yes or no, you fool!
# + look
There's a little cave with a little door with a little note on it.
# + look (kerrek dead, before riches)
There's a disgusting little Jhonka hopping around outside a little cave.A fat pile of riches lies next to him.
# + look (after kerrek dead, after take riches)
There's a disgusting little Jhonka hopping around outside a little cave. 
# + look club/turkey leg (when he's outside)
Turkey leg or no, it looks like the Jhonka's been gnawing on it.
# + look cave
Just a little cave. Calm down.
# + look fence
A standard peasant fence. Trogdor makes milk's meat outta these things.
# + look jhonka (when he's outside)
The Jhonka is gray and grody. He's got a cromagnon forehead and jaw with a pair of wicked incisors. He sports an old loin-cheese cloth and carries either a big club or one of those roasted turkey legs you got at the Ren Fest.
# + read note (before killing Kerrek)
+ It says "scared of kerrek. go way. -j"
# + (walk in haystack)
Hey, nice disguise! The Jhonka doesn't seem to notice you.
# + steal riches
Oh OH! A stiff breeze blew all the hay and, surprisingly, the mud off of you! "You take my riches?!" growls the Jhonka.
# + no
"Okay. Lemme know if you see riches anywhere," he grunts and goes back to his hopping. You smooth talker, you.
# + ask about fire
"Burninator make fire! Barbecue all peasants!"
# + ask about Jhonka
"The Kerrek is dead!" he cries and hops around some more. You wonder how someone this primitive could have made that much dough. 
# + ask about naked ned (or) robe
"Filthy naked peasant! Stay away from my cave-hole!" Who's he calling naked? HE'S the one wearing the string bikini.
# + ask about smell
"Kerrek smell! Now Kerrek dead!" screeches the Jhonka. So you can infer from this that all smells are dead? You always sucked at the analytical questions.
# + ask about trogdor
"All hail Burninator! Trogdor Number One! Beat Peasant Tech!" says the grimy Jhonka.
# + ask about (unknown)
"Jhonka don't know nothing bout that!"
# + yes (to the Jhonka when he asks you about his riches)
'I KILL YOU!!' screams the Jhonka.
# {The Jhonka clubs you to death}  (Warning: Obviously, you will die.) 
Club or turkey leg, the jhonka sure just beat you senseless with whatever he was holding. You dead. Thanks for playing!
# + open door
It's locked. With one o' them SCHLAGE deadbolts, too. Those things are hard core.
# + knock (while he's inside)
A gravelly voice inside yells,
'JUST US CHICKENS'
# or
'NO FOR RENT'
# or 
'I GIVE LAST YEAR!'
# or 
'GAVE AT OFFICE'
# or: 
'GO WAY!'
# + kill jhonka (outside)
No way! Jhonka's are born scrappers. He may be little, but he'll crawl ya.
# + get club (when he's out)
Now there's a surefire way to get yourself killed.
# + get note
It's been magically sealed to the door with a wondrously whimsical spell.
# + give riches (before jumping in hay)
The Jhonka will see you! And rip out your jugular with his teeth or something equally horrible.
# + talk jhonka (while inside the hay)
Not now! You'll blow your cover!

# Your Burninated Cottage
##########################

# + look
The remains of your thatched-roof cottage lie before you. You swear revenge against Trogdor.
# + look cottage
All your baubles and trinkets, your flasks and scrolls, your goblets and staffs! BURNINATED!! (And then, if you haven't taken the map yet:) Looks like there's a piece of unburninated paper on the ground. 
# + look ground
Hey, it's your old fireproof map to Peasantry. 
# + look paper
Hey, it's your old fireproof map to Peasantry. 
# + get map (in right spot?)
You tuck it nice-like into your short, short pants. Type MAP at nearly any time to check the map.
# + get map (if you already have it)
Yeah but like you already map the took, guy!

# Pebble Lake West
###################

# + look
There's definitely half a lake here with a sandy shore.
# + look lake/water
It extends onto the next screen and has a sandy shore.
# + look sand (after pebbles)
Remember those pebbles on the beach? Man, those were good times. 
# + look bush
Don't worry about that bush. Yeah, there's red berries on it but never you mind.
# + look berries
Shut up.
# + get pebbles
You grab up a handful of fairly substantial pebbles. You make sure to get an even mix of sedentary, igneous, and, um, sureptitious rocks.
# + throw baby
Something tells you this is a good idea and you lob the little one into the lake.
You won't be arrested after all! The little guy has resurfaced safely, carrying an old bottle of soda. You take the soda and stow your swaddling buddy for takeoff.
# + swim
Not in this game, Swimmer Dan! In this game, you drown. 
# + skip stones
You've always been terrible at skipping stones. And you're even worse at just plain throwing rocks in lakes. You decide to save yourself the embarrassment.
# + get berries
NO MAN! JEEZ! 
# + get pebbles/rocks (from too far)
You do your best Mr. Fantastic impression, but you can't reach from here. 
# + throw baby (before getting the baby)
I think you misread the walkthrough on GameFAQs. You gotta get the baby first.
# + throw baby (after getting the soda)
Baby Dashing is a little waterlogged from the toss, and you read his soft gurgling to mean that there's no more soda left.
# + throw baby/feed (at south side)
Maybe try again from the center of the lake. Looks deeper there.

# Pebble Lake East
###################

# + look / look lake
Why it's half a lake.
# + look (when the old man is fishing)
Why it's half a lake.With a fisherman in it. And he's fishing! 
# + look man/guy/peasant/old guy/old man (while he is fishing)
An older peasant sits silently in a boat with his line in the water.
# + look sand
One million three hundred thousand seventy-four hundred and sixty two... One million three hundred thousand seventy-four hundred and sixty three... Drat! You lost count again.
# + look boat/dinghy (while he is fishing)
Keep your eyes off my dinghy!
# + look boat/dinghy (after he is gone)
It was loaned out to the Fishing Challenge videogame. 
# + talk man (before throwing chicken feed in lake)
You holler at the old man about Trogdor, but he just grumbles about the fish not biting. "Must be using the wrong bait..." he says, suggestively.
# + throw chicken feed
You toss the feed into the lake. You shed a tear for each one. "Goodbye, Monty" you sniff. "Bye Delga, Rasputin. Farewell, Combledon!" and so forth.
Woah! That crotchety old man just caught a pantload of fish! "Now I can get back to running the inn," he says and rows to shore and hauls his boat out and cleans, guts, and filets all the fish and a buncha other stuff we didn't animate.
# + throw feed (before getting the feed)
You have nothing with which to do that...with.
# + throw feed (after throwing the feed)  (The repetition is probably just a goof.) 
You already fed the fish. Let's get moving here, people! You already fed the fish. Let's get moving here, people!
# + throw baby/feed (at south side)
Maybe try again from the center of the lake. Looks deeper there.
# + throw (anything but the feed while he is fishing)
'That isn't gonna work for bait!' the old man screams, at a needlessly harsh volume.
# + throw (anything when fisherman gone)
You already fed the fish. Let's get moving, here, people!


####################
# Outside Giant Inn
####################

# + look
There's a giant Inn here. It takes up, like, the entire screen.
# + look door
Just a door. A door with a note on it.
# + look inn
Looks okay from out here. But do they have a free breakfast buffet?
# + look sign
If you can't read that sign, you need to quit playing this game. 
# + look window
Check it out! There's an INN in there.
# + read note (before feed in lake)
It says, "Gone Fishin" just like that grog coozie your cousin got you.
# + open door (after old man)
You open the door and step inside the inn.
# + open door (before old man)
It's locked fast!
# + knock (closed)
No answer.

What is it with you and notes?! No!!
