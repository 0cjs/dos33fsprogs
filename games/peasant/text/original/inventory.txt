em! This arrow's kinda pointy even!!
# baby
Awww! Peasant babies are
adorable. No wonder they fetch
such a pretty penny on the black
market.

Phew! This thing stinks like all

have kidnapped a hot wench or
something that you coulda saved?
# chicken feed
Woah! Gold nuggets! Oh
wait...This is just chicken
feed. Crap.
# SuperTime FunBow TM
This is a pretty fancy bow.
You're suprised those shady
archers give away such decent
prizes. You half-expected gold
fish in a bag.
# monster maskus
Man, those pagans sure can make
a freaky lookin mask when they
want to.  It's like those theatre
masks' evil uncle or something
# pebbles
Woah! Gray chicken feed! Oh
wait... those are just pebbles.
Heavier than they look, though.
# pills
The innkeeper's medication says
it's supposed to tread "general
oldness.  May cause checkers 
playing, hiked-up pants, and
overall pee smell."
# riches
Riches, dude. Riches. That
peasant lady totally has to
share some of this with you,

clawed sceptre thing.
# robe
A propa peasant robe. It smells
freshly washed and has the
initials 'N.N' sewn onto the
tag.
# soda
A full bottle of popular soda.
# meatball sub
A piping hot meatball sub fresh
from the bottom of a dingy old
well.  All you need is a bag of
chips and you've got a combo

# super trinket
This super trinket is weird. It
looks like it could either kill
you or make you the hit of your
Christmas party.
# TrogHelmet
The TrogHelmet is not screwing
around.  It's a serious helmet.
It also protects against
harmful UV rays.
# TrogShield
Behold the TrogSheild! No
seriously, behold it.  There's
no way Trogdor's fire breath can
penetrate this thing.
# TrogSword
The TrogSword is for real.
Hands-down the coolest item in
this whole game. You can't wait
to lop off that beefy arm of
Trogdor's with this guy.
# ???
# t-shirt
This has got to be your favorite
T-Shirt ever. Oh, the times you
had at Scalding Lake. Canoeing,
fishing, stoning heathens. What
a Blast!
