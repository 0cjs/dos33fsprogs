Demakes

HGr-MIST

HGR
	(horrible hgr)

Backgrounds
	AGI-like?  They abandoned it.  Would save space

Priority backgrounds, like AGI
	+ load at $400, lo-res
	+ Can't use screen holes tricky (original Apple II 4k of RAM
		so need to put slot info in first 4k)

Sprites
	easier in blocks 0f 7
	still have to rotate 1 pixel for odd columns
	transparency a pain with color clash

Animations
	too big?

Mini-games?

Text
	HGR drawing lib (no built in on 2)
	How to fit?  Lookup for common word distribution?
	
Ram-map

Music
	Mockingboard, pt3 player
	no mockingboard, electric duet, but can't do more than
		page flip (missing flame).  Worth it?

Speech
	Can we do SAM?  9k?
	SSI-263 but unobtanium

Disks:
	Fitting on disk.
	swappign fun for nostalgia, not so much when actually playing
