TODO:

+ consolidate the lookup info for message box sizes, as in the
	end only Y2 is changing

+ background priority mask not working when at far top of screen
+ ESC SKIPS at top of intro
+ Loading screen is slow when getting names
	Print "Loading" message while doing it?
+ After loading, no need to clear text before moving to next level

+ complete waterfall, including animation
+ update intro to walk closer to edges
+ fix issue where walking stops when you cross to screen w priority

+ re-do how off edge-of-screen works (have destination for all 4 co-ords?)
+ move drawing to PAGE1 and use PAGE2 for RAM?
	This would remove backing store when drawing text boxes?

+ optimize text box sizes
+ replace parse_input lookup with a giant jump table

Border special cases:
	+ Mountain pass walking to Inn
	+ Jhonka cave walking to Cottage
