+ draw roughly circular bg destruction when lemming explodes
+ wait a second after last lemming gone to exit
+ update the "in" %
+ dig off the map, end level
+ fill in some of the ground so we don't get stuck when digging
+ "Out" counter is only printed to page1 so gets erased by cursor
+ Falling too far and you go splat
+ See if the jerky animation is due to starting at an odd x vs
	even x, maybe we should start animation 4 frames in if that's
	the case.  Or maybe it's the shift for odd frames, make
	the shift the other way if walking left/right
+ Add floater
+ Add stopper
+ Add climber

+ when nuke, they should stop coming out of the door
+ offset the frames when nuking so not simultaneous
+ on explosion, start with invisible 6 so we always get a full 5s

+ nuke/exploding should not happen if lemming is splatting
	or already exploding

+ green flame for ice level
