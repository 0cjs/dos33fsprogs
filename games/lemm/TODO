Improve explosions
+ offset the frames when nuking so not simultaneous
+ on explosion, start with invisible 6 so we always get a full 5s
+ Make particles thicker?  Look fine, not show up in recordings
+ Erase particles as last step

Request from internet:
+ Acceleration on cursor movement keys
	This is trickier than it sounds

Change wait delay on levels with bg animations?
Have 20 lemmings on some levels?
Only scan for Maximum Lemming number rather than maximum possible number?


+ have bridge stop building when hits wall
	(real game, reverses too maybe?)
+ wait a second after last lemming gone to exit
+ fill in some of the ground so we don't get stuck when digging
+ See if the jerky animation is due to starting at an odd x vs
	even x, maybe we should start animation 4 frames in if that's
	the case.  Or maybe it's the shift for odd frames, make
	the shift the other way if walking left/right
