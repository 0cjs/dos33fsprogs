Implementation details:
	+ stoppers have special $10 line behind them
		has to be special so climbers can't treat it as wall
		and climb
	+ bridge is solid $FF color.  Allow things to walk through this,
		so shouldn't allow backgrounds to have this pattern


Plan for future scrolling:
	+ Foreground drawn with a tilemap
		Write program to pick optimal tiles
		5 wide screen = ? in size
		Scroll the tilemap
	+ Actual collision detection happens in offscreen buffer
		Each pixel equivalent is one 7-pixel chunk wide
		Should be small enough
		Physics engine happens entirely on that



Heights for detection:
	Walking lemming = 10 high
	Floating lemming = 16 high

	Detect ground (walking) = y+10?
	Detect in ground (need to bump up) = ?
	Height we detect wall collision = ?





LEMM: 23782 (original v0.01)


Plan:
	$000 = zero page
	$100 = stack
	$300 = disk lookup tables
	$400-$700 = text page 1
	$800-$b00 = hgr lookup tables
	$c00-$f00 = particle effects?
	$1000-$1100 = disk code
	$1200-$1f00 = common routines

	HGR PAGE1 = $2000
	HGR PAGE2 = $4000

	LEMM load at $6000

	LEVELs load at $A000

	SOUND/MUSIC data in language card at $D000


level data
	number of lemmings
	number needed to win (percent?  percent is hard)
	lemming_start_x
	lemming_start_y
	lemming_start_direction
	location of entrance door
	entrace door type
	location of exit door
	number of each job type
	release speed
