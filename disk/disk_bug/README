NOTE: in the end this was a bug in qkumba's qboot, not AppleWin

this is a test case for a possible AppleWin bug

there is possibly a bug in AppleWin 1.29.14.0 when the disk2 drive
is in "authentic" mode where when you switch disks in the virtual drive,
the first sector you read after that returns the wrong value.

this can be tested with the two disk images here
