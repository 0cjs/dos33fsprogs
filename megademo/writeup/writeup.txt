Notes on the MEGADEMO


Finding HBLANK/VBLANK on the Apple II:

	To do fancy mode switching, we need to switch graphic modes
	(by writing to a soft-switch address) at the exact time we want
	to switch modes.
	Finding this is difficult on the original Apple II.
	Unlike other machines,
	there is no register or interrupt that tells where the scan
	currently is.  (Later IIe, IIc and IIgs models do add such a 
	register, but each is incompatible with the others)

	The way this is found is to use a weird quirk of the Apple II:
	the "floating bus".  If you read from a softswitch that doesn't
	drive the bus, you get back the last value written due to the
	residual capacitance on the bus lines.  The Apple II writes the
	display each half cycle, so the values on this bus are the last
	written video display value.
	By drawing a pattern on the screen you can repeatedly read
	this floating bus and figure out where on the screen you are,
	and then calculate from there.

	This is a well known feature of the bus (it was described
	in the early 80s by at various times Bishop, Sather and Lancaster)
	but was not widely used, partly because it was a pain to do,
	but also because Apple made no guarantees this accidental
	behavrior would continue to be available.

Cycle counting on the 6502:

	Cycle counting on an old 8-bit chip is a lot easier than on
	modern hardware, as the cycle counts are mostly deterministic
	(unlike a modern system that has out-of-order, caches, etc).

	There are some issues that can get you:
	* Conditional branches, taken take 3 cycles, not-taken 2 cycles.
	* Some load/store instructions can take an extra cycle if the
	  indexing crosses a 256-byte boundary.  This means your code
	  might suddenly take longer if it ends up misaligned.
        * Branches also take longer if they cross a 256-byte page boundary.
	* The 65C02 chip found in newer Apple IIs have some timing
	  differences from the NMOS 6502.  One that is easy to get
	  caught on is using JMP indirect (used for jump tables).
          There is a workaround for jump tables by pushing the value
          to be jumped onto the stack and then doing a "rts" return
	  instruction to jump to it.


Notes on each screen:

+ Opening C64 screen

	HGR/Text split.  The curtain opening effect isn't as great as
	it could be.  The fastest you can switch modes on the II is
	4 cycles, and in 4 cycles 28 pixels are output in hiresmode
	(4 text chars wide).

+ Falling Apple II
	This is done in the 40x96 forced lores mode, where it switches
	between the two lo-res pages halfway through to double the
	vertical resolution.

	This was supposed to scroll into place but that got sidetracked,
	especially as it's not possible to copy a full 1k lores screen
	in 60Hz.

+ Incoming Message
	This flips between page1/page2 again, but in text mode which allows
	faking some lowercase looking characters on the original Apple II
	which has no lowercase support.  Things like lowercase O can be
	made with the bottom half of an 8.  Unfortunately the split to
	get "o" makes it not possible to get things like umlauts using
	".

	One tricky thing here is between the Apple II and the IIe
	they changed how font generation worked and all the characters
	were shifted up one vertical line.  To fix that the demo
	detects the newer hardware and self-modifies the code to work
	on both.

	This screen also does a Text/lores split

+ Starring
	The first part is flipping between Lores Page1/Page2 and Hires Page1
	to create a cheap animated effect.

	In theory the hires colors are a subset of lores so you can make
	exact matches, but in practice the generation in those modes is
	off a bit so the text shifts a bit.
	In theory you could add in Hires Page2 as well to get 4 frames,
	but that would take another 8k of memory which we can't afford.

	The timing code for this is the only place where I actually do
	the trick of jumping into the middle of a BIT instruction 
	which gets interpreted as a harmless nop for timing reasons.

+ Cast of characters
	This is a Lores/Hires split, with some fancy copying from offscreen
	memory to do the name flip.

+ Leaving
	This has a split of text on top, lores on bottom.

	These animated scenes are actually harder than some of the others.
	Any time you have if/then/else type setups, you have to make
	sure both branches (then vs else) take the *exact* same number
	of cycles, and that's difficult to do.
	So little scenes with a lot of movement in complex directions
	quickly become a pain.

+ Bird in front of Mountain

	This is a text/hires/lores three-way split with some animation
	of sprites going on.
	The sprites take different amounts of time to draw depending
	on the pattern so the code has to account for this.

	The text scrolling is actually fairly easy to do, no real
	tricks with that.

+ Waterfall

	This effect does some tricky lores 1/2 shifting ot where
	the split happens to create an automated water effect, and
	there are gaps which give a fake transparency effect when
	the sprite walks behind the waterfall.

	This code wasn't too awful to write, but making it small
	using self-modifying code.

+ Rocket Takeoff

	HGR/GR split, though it's subtle, but notice how the top
	of the rocket's tail has a smooth diagonal.

	Again scripting these behavios cycle exact is a pain with
	state-machines, jump-tables, and self modifying code at times.

+ Mode7 flying

	This is a SNES-style mode7 pseudo-3d effect.  If you're 
	interested in how this works see my PoC||GTFO 0x18 article.

+ Saturn flyby

	This is a TEXT/GR/HGR, but the GR/HGR part is mid-screen to
	give sort of a tiered look.
	It is tricky to do this on the fly.
	The original goal was to have the rasterbars coming in
	be 40x96 mode giving a much more impressive look, but it turns
	out switching HIRES to LORES and also PAGE0 to PAGE1 at the
	same time takes too many cycles.
	It might still be possible to do this effect if the HGR picture
	was mirrored in both PAGE1 and PAGE2, but we are using PAGE2 for
	code and don't have the room to do this.

+ Arrival
	Very similar to the leaving.
	There are more effects I'd like to do but ran out of time.

+ Fireworks
	This is a HIRES/LORES split, but with the bottom of the screen
	doing interlaced every-other line LORES to give the gradient
	effect.
	The code is based on a BASIC program by Fozztexx which was modified
	to have custom random routine, and also a deterministic HPLOT
	(hi-res plot) routine.  The original code used HPLOT TO (to draw
	lines in some cases) but making that deterministic was too much
	of a hassle and was left off.
	The interleaved text scrolling effect looks nice and came more
	or less for free (well, for twice the string data).


Other notes:
	Hires apple graphics conversion uses the BMP2DHR util by
	Bill Buckels which has knowledge of the weird Apple II hires
	modes so does a better job than a regular paint program would.
