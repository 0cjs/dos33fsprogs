Q: Is this based on a true story?

A: I took some artistic liberties.

   For example, the real Froggysue wouldn't be caught dead in a dress.


Q: Why is the e-mail in German?

A: I like German.

   Also I thought it would let me use some umlauts, but it turns out
   you can either get lowecase "o" or umlauts but not really both.
   Getting "o" also means you can't get dotted i and j either, which
   is a shame.  In theory I could try to alter the timing per-line
   but that would be more trouble than it is worth.

   Real-life Froggysue does not speak German, alas.


Q: Why is Deater's spaceship parked so far away from his house?
