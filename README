These are some tools for manipulating Apple II disk files that
I've written over the years while doing Apple 2 hacking.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


make_b : take a machine language blob and give it the size/offset
         header needed to BLOAD it from DOS3.3


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	 

asoft_detoken: takes an applesoft file obtained with dos33
               and converts it to an ASCII text file


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	       
tokenize_asoft: takes an ASCII text file and converts it
                into a tokenized applesoft file


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


dos33:		a tool for manipulating dos33 .dsk images


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


dos33_text2ascii: convert a dos33 text file to ASCII


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


integer_detoken: detokenize an Apple Integer BASIC program


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


pcx2hgr:	converts a 140x160 (or 140x192) PCX image file
                into an Apple II HGR graphics file that can 
		be loaded with "BLOAD IMAGE,A$2000"

		To get it to work, create an image with the GIMP.
		Scale to 140x160.  Save as indexed with the 
		included "hgr.pal" palette.

                It also works with 280x160 but in that case it ignores
		colors and only generates black and white output.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


mkdos33fs:	create an Apple ][ DOS 3.3 filesystems


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

asoft_presenter:

    creates a slide presentation disk image for use on apple II

    see README.presenter for more documentation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

shape_table:  create an Apple shape table for use with
              DRAW and XDRAW commands
	      
	      can generate BASIC code to load it (via DATA) or
	      else a binary version that can be BLOADed
	      
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

asoft_compact: tries to compress your Applesoft basic program
               to make it as small as possible
