These are some tools for manipulating Apple II disk files that
I've written over the years while doing Apple 2 hacking.

make_b : take a machine language blob and give it the size/offset
         header needed to BLOAD it from DOS3.3
	 
asoft_detoken: takes an applesoft file obtained with dos33
               and converts it to an ASCII text file
	       
tokenize_asoft: takes an ASCII text file and converts it
                into a tokenized applesoft file
		
dos33:		a tool for manipulating dos33 .dsk images
