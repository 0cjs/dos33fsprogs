<h1>Applesoft Portal FAQ</h1>

This project turned out way more popular than I expected.  Usually
I make a silly video, forward it to a few friends, and maybe send
it to hackaday (or adafruit if it involved a raspberry pi).
Rarely do I get more than a few thousand hits.
<br><br>

I'm too lazy to make an account on all the sites that covered this,
so here's a bunch of responses to questions that came up.

<ol>
<li><b>Have you tried a BASIC compiler?</b>
<br><br>
	The hackernews commentators seem to understand this best.
	<br><br>

	The challenge/fun of this project was trying to take something modern
	and reimplementing it in a medium that seems impossible (see
	the con-tiki project).
	<br><br>

	Using a BASIC compiler or using assembly language would definitely
	make the game run faster/better/allow more features, but at
	the same time then the project just becomes a standard Apple II
	2-D platform game (of which there were many, the pinnacle
	probably being Prince of Persia which is frankly amazing for
	the hardware it was on).
	<br><br>
	
<li><b>Wow your IIe platinum looks amazing.  Did you retrobrite it?</b>
<br><br>

No. I should post a picture, but shielded parts of the case are definitely
much much whiter than exposed parts.  It's just compared to the tan
of non-platinum IIes it looks original.
<br><br>

<li><b>Was it cool being interviewed by theregister?</b><br><br>

Yes, though mildly disappointed I didn't get referred to as a "boffin".
I did find their "The cake is a IIe" tagline particularly inspired
<br><br>

<li><b>Is the Apple II's hires mode as bad as you make it sound?</b><br><br>

Worse actually.  BASIC typically hides most of the complexity from you.
I was being difficult by trying
to get colored output using the DRAW/XDRAW shapetable support which
is a silly thing to even attempt.  You'll note in the code I cheated
a bit to accomplish this.<br><br>

I won't admit how much time I wasted trying to get the colors right
on my VMW logo on the title screen.  If you'll look closely you'll
see I had to compromise on at least one of the pixels.
<br><br>

<li><b>You said that it took a week to put this together?</b><br><br>

Yes, though I had some pre-existing tools (for example the pcx to hgr
converter, the shape table compiler, and the disk image writer)
that sped up the process.  Though they also slowed things down
as I wasted time re-writing (and re-indenting) the code as it was
old and much of it is coded really inefficiently.
<br><br>

<li><b>Do you really code your webpages by hand?</b><br><br>

Yes.  Using the nano editor.  You don't even want to know
how I check my e-mail.
<br><br>

<li><b>What's the workflow for how you made this?</b><br><br>

I edit the text on a Linux box, using a text editor (nano).
I use a custom BASIC tokenizer and a dos33 utility to put the files
in a disk image (a Makefile handles all this).  Then I run things
under the Linapple emulator to test.  Once it all works I transfer
to a USB key which I hook up to the CFFA3000 disk emulator inside
of my IIe.  If I want to transfer to a floppy I use Copy II plus
to the floppy drives in slot #5.
<br><br>

<li><b>This is your second Applesoft game conversion.
	Do you plan any others?</b>
<br><br>
	No.  That doesn't mean it won't happen though.
	Only certain kind of games map well to this kind of project,
	and it has to be a game I enjoy playing enough to get a good
	feel for the gameplay.  A certain amount of procrastination
	is involved too.
<br><br>

<li><b>Why is the disk image called glados33.dsk?</b><br><br>

	It was an obscure joke due to the fact that the disk image
	is in Apple DOS 3.3 format.
	<br><br>

<li><b>Did you like the Portal games?</b>
<br><br>
	Yes.  Though I might be alone in thinking this, but
	I really didn't like the Portal2 Wheatley character much, I found
	him really annoying.
<br><br>

<li><b>Why is there no cake? Was it a lie?</b>
	<br><br>
	It turns out to be really hard to draw a convincing cake,
	either in ASCII art or in pixel form.  After wasting a long
	time perfecting the companion cube I decided not to bother.
<br><br>

<li><b>Why is the video so grainy in the "Still Alive" credits?</b>
	<br><br>
	The Apple II's "NTSC" output was a bit nonstandard at the
	best of times, even when in 40 column mode.  The composite to VGA
	scan converter I am using can barely display this, and
	it doesn't really handle the higher-bandwidth 80 column mode 
	well at all.  Yes, I was too lazy to find a CRT for purposes
	of making this video.
	<br><br>


<li><b>Why does the title screen imply it has been "cracked"?</b>
	<br><br>
	Growing up many of the Apple II games I played were from floppies
	of dubious provenance.  To me it feels traditional for there
	to be some sort of cracked copy protection notice on
	the title screen.
<br><br>

<li><b>How do you make your videos?</b>
	<br><br>
	A cheap Canon camera and a tripod.  I edit things together
	with kdenlive which crashes a lot but mostly works.
	The biggest issue I have is trying to record my desktop for
	the emulator scenes, as I can never get the Linux microphone
	support to work well.
	<br><br>

<li><b>Where did you get your time machine?</b>
	<br><br>
	Well I traded this crazy looking guy some plutonium...
	<br><br>
	No, really, I just like blinky LED lights and it's the perfect
	project if you like that kind of thing.  I was vaguely trying
	to get it all finished for the BTTF2/2015 anniversary and it was
	mostly working but I had grand plans to put it in my car for
	a while but that never happened.
	You can find out more
	<a href="http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/hardware/time_circuit/">
	here</a>.<br><br>
	There are plans and mostly enough info to build your
	own copy if you want.  
	A few people have tried, but I've never heard back
	on any successes.
	<br><br>


<li><b>Has Valve sent you a cease-and-desist letter yet?</b><br><br>

	Not yet.
