"Portal" in Applesoft BASIC!

After finishing Portal (late to the game as always) I felt inspired
to do the closing credits/still_alive song on an Apple II, as I found
most other architectures already have a version.

And once I've done that, it's a short step to implementing the rest of
the game.

It's not really complete (it was really meant as a demo for the video)
but it's surprisingly playable.

I'm about at the limit of what you can do in an 8kB Applesoft program.
The frame rate is much worse than the early versions too.

My biggest issue was with trying to get all 6 colors displaying properly,
especially when using shape tables.  I guess one can curse and praise
the Woz simultaneously.
