Working on getting the Uthernet II card to do something interesting.

Hardware Background:

	This board has a WIZnet W5100 on board.  You can get raw Ethernet
	packets on the board, but I am using it in hardware TCP/IP mode
	where I set up the MAC/IP and then get raw packets from a TCP socket
	(up to 4 sockets can be active at once).

Webserver:
	Included is a webserver written for Fall 2015 ECE435

	It is written entirely in Applesoft BASIC

	It runs very slowly, but works.  

	firefox and wget can get files just fine,
	although they tend to send duplicate requests for some reason.

	You can serve arbitrary png, jpg, txt, or html files, however
	they currently have to be less than 8kB.

	Much of the slowness is using peek/poke as a memcpy routine.

	Of course this would all be faster in assembly language, but
	what's the fun of that.
