some small shape table programs

mostly trying to get something interesting in 16 bytes for Lovebyte

apple2		-- 63 bytes -- just prints apple ][
cool_wave	-- 37 bytes -- rotating square wave with backgrounds
gear		-- 138 bytes -- rotating gears
herring16	-- 16 bytes  -- sort of a herringbone pattern
line16		-- 17 bytes -- fancy line pattern
line32		-- 32 bytes -- line pattern, got it down to 18 bytes at one point
pattern		-- 32 bytes -- like line32 but stops
pattern_logo	-- 125 bytes -- fancy pattern with apple ][ logo on top
square_wave	-- 35 bytes  -- another square wave w/ backgrounds
stripe17	-- 17 bytes -- simple line drawing
teeth32		-- 31 bytes -- rotating square waves (boring)
tick_tock	-- 26 bytes -- gear teeth pattern
