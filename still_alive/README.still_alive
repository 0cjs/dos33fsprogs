Fun fact:
	The letter 'Z' does not appear at all in the lyrics to the song.
	(Noticed when I had to edge comparison for uppercase off by one)


Challenges:
	+ 6-channel audio
	+ Fitting it all in 48k (want to avoid disk routines if can)
	+ Printing the ASCII art simple code (takes longer than 50Hz)

ASCII Art Size
	The ASCII art is roughly 7k.
	You can LZ4 compress it and decompress on the fly, saving 3k or
	so even when factoring in the decompression code.
	The problem is decompression is slower (pauses the music) and
	can't be run at the same time as the music decompression is
	happening unless we duplicate a lot of code.
	May revisit if we need the room.


Goal: Binary fits in 16k (16384 bytes)

note						size (bytes)
---------------------				------
initial music player:				 2078
add raw ascii art:				 9142
add 3-channel music+lyrics,then slim a bit:	18787
initial 40 col support:				18864
have art loading properly 40col:		18910
lz4 encode the ascii art:			15529
revert because lz4 code not re-entrant:		18910
add 4-channel music (KR4):			20128
add cursor (a bit distracting)			20162
feature complete 40 col:			20180
intial 80 col support:				20191
80 col cursor:					20344
strip out some unneeded text printing:		19962
