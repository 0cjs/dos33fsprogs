Thus was born---> Tom Bombem
Linux version has cooler MOD based sound.

Released to a few local BBSes in Maryland.
Optimisitically Sent a copy to ID software (by then 3D realms).
Nice letter, basically looks decent but we've moved onto 3D games now.


Sound Blaster code, Ethan Brodsky, wasn't any older than me.
Graphcis in Deluxe Paint (screengrab).

Story!
	-> My copout for not having full audio track
	-> People in my HS really liked that.
	-> ALl sound effects just me saying them.

	=> original develop w/o internet.  Made my own RLE
		file format.


	-> I used to doodle these Aliens, thinking they were original,
		but clearly they are based on the ones in Commander Keen

	-> Level 3 meant to be one where you walk around with keycards
		to turn off the tractor beam (wonder where that came from).
		Off to college, never finished.
