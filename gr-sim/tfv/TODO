Tom Bombem Video
	+ Viewers know I started out on Apple II.  But like most
		people in the 90s I went through a DOS phase before
		I moved onto Linux around 1996 or so.
	+ Started out with GWBASIC and some CGA graphics games.
		Fighter game
	+ QBASIC
		SW3FLIGHT?
	+ Progressed to Turbo Pascal
		AITAS.  Note that I finished the story but not gameplay.
		Based on a radio drama we wrote in 8th grade.
		See if you can guess the names of those involved.
	+ Underwater Trouble
	+ EGA/PASCAL (AITAS, UNDERWATER)

	=> original develop w/o internet.  Made my own RLE
		file format.
	=> End graphics with THEDRAW.  Used to make mediocre ANSI
	art for BBSes

	+In germany, impressed, passed me a copy of PCGPE
		(show screenshot).
	So I moved onto Pascal and x86 assembly.
	Mode13h, 386 opcodes for speed.


Thus was born---> Tom Bombem
Linux version has cooler MOD based sound.

Released to a few local BBSes in Maryland.
Optimisitically Sent a copy to ID software (by then 3D realms).
Nice letter, basically looks decent but we've moved onto 3D games now.


Sound Blaster code, Ethan Brodsky, wasn't any older than me.
Graphcis in Deluxe Paint (screengrab).

Story!
	-> My copout for not having full audio track
	-> People in my HS really liked that.
	-> ALl sound effects just me saying them.



	-> I used to doodle these Aliens, thinking they were original,
		but clearly they are based on the ones in Commander Keen

	-> Level 3 meant to be one where you walk around with keycards
		to turn off the tractor beam (wonder where that came from).
		Off to college, never finished.
