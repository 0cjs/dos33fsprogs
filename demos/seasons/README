	Video captured on AppleWin emulator.  Should run on real
	hardware but all of my Apple II hardware is on lockdown at work.

Files:
	SEASONS  -- 127 byte executable
	seasons.s -- source code, can assemble with ca65 assembler
	seasons.dsk -- 140k Apple DOS33 disk image suitable for use in emulator

Notes:
	+ 128 Byte demo for the Apple II (1MHz 6502)
	+ Written in 6502 assembly language
	+ Uses "high-resolution" graphics mode which is 280x192 in 6 colors.
		This mode has lots of complex color-clash and memory-interleave
		issues which make it a pain to code for.
	+ The Apple II has very simple graphics.  No hardware sprites, no
		VBLANK/HBLANK interrupts, no scrolling, no palette
		changes, no acceleration of any type.  The only feature
		it has is two graphics pages
		for page flipping (which is not used in this demo)
	+ Depends on the Applesoft BASIC ROM for "HPLOT" routine
		which means it requires at least an Apple II+ (released in
		1979) or later machine.
		Should work on a II+/IIe/IIc/IIgs, and even an original
		Apple II (1977) if you have an Applesoft language card
		ROM expansion
	+ Based on Hellmood's 64B DOS demo "Autumn"
	+ Saves a few bytes by running entirely in the zero page
