Apple II Twitter bot demo

Won 1st place retro demo at Demosplash 2020

Tricky as it is running small basic programs (that fit in 280 bytes)
while mockingboard music plays in the background, then manages to stop
after time, re-load another basic program, and execute, all from
the interrupt handler

you'll need a IIe and a Mockingboard for this one as it depends on
the interrupts to work.
