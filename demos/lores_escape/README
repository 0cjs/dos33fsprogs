Apple II Lores Escape Demo

presented at Demosplash 2019 (came in 3rd retro demo)

was doing too much that year

had to fix bugs (with memory not being inited to zero) right before
it was presented

struggled with the sound transition from cycle-counted to interrupt
driven

bass sound still not 100% great much to Dya's disappointment
