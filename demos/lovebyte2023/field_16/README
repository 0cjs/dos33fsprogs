This is yet another tiny Apple II hires/shapetable intro.

It loads at $E7 (HGR_SCALE) so that we set that value
for free from the first instruction (in this case JSR so $20).

I thought this result at times looked like a field of grain,
hence the name.

I found this one while doing a search of ROM values that were
easy to load the address for, but the results looked nice.
In this case the rotation and ROM address are $F6 and $F6F5
which makes it easy to load, though it is a byte bigger than
the minimum because I need a DEX instruction to get the address right.
