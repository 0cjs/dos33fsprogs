This effect was found when trying to do a fancy screen
wipe for the "Peasant's Quest" game.

It was surprisingly popular when posted to the Apple II
Twitter Bot (RIP) so I modified it into a Lovebyte entry.

It's essentially just reading "random" data from the Applesoft ROM
and drawing it row by row to the screen which looks a bit
like glitched vertical columns.
