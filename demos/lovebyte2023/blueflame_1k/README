BlueFlame, 1k Apple II Hi-res demo presented at Lovebyte 2023

Code by Deater
Music by MA2E
ZX02 compression by DMSC

1k entries are difficult as it's so much bitter than 256 bytes so you
feel like you should be able to do a lot, but at the same time it's
a lot more work for not much better production.

The shape-table letter motions were the first idea and turned out well.
It's convenient DEATER and DESIRE share so many letters.  Also thought
maybe A DEMO or DEMO OVER could be printed but that ended up not being
necessary.

The "blue flame" is essentially my attempt at the Doom Fire for hi-res.
It's actually doing the effect on PAGE2 and copying to PAGE1 each frame.

The "static column" effect was a 32-byte effect I had come up with a while
ago.

The parallax-sierpinski at the beginning was an attempt to do some sort
of hi-res parallax effect on the Apple II.  Scrolling hi-res is slow at
the best of times so I was using sierpinski (and) and boxes (xor) to
make things simpler, and even then the framerate isn't that great.

The music is by MA2E and uses a simple 2-track music tracker I have.

This was compressed with ZX02 compression.  The small ZX02 decompressor
is around 130 bytes of code, but the music especially compressed more than
this so it was a win.  It did make size-optimizing difficult as optimizing
for compression is dificult.  Shaving bytes off the uncompressed code can
actually make the compressed image bigger.
