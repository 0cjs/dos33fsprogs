Some rotating gears.

The gears are drawn with the shapetable vector graphics, we only
have a definition for a single tooth but we then draw it multiple
times while rotating.

The catchment at the top happened accidentally, as I originally wanted
to have a desire logo but didn't have enough room for the whole thing.
The truncated logo ends up being exactly the shape that gets drawn.

It's a fast animation because it draws two scenes to the two graphics
PAGEs and is just page-flipping between them.
