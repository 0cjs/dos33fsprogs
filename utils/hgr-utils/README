These are some tools for manipulating HGR Apple 2 graphics.


pcx2hgr:	converts a 140x160 (or 140x192) PCX image file
                into an Apple II HGR graphics file that can 
		be loaded with "BLOAD IMAGE,A$2000"

		To get it to work, create an image with the GIMP.
		Scale to 140x160.  Save as indexed with the 
		included "hgr.pal" palette.

                It also works with 280x160 but in that case it ignores
		colors and only generates black and white output.

	      else a binary version that can be BLOADed
